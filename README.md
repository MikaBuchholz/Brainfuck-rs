This is a Brainfuck compiler written in rust that can:

- Compile Brainfuck to c
- Optimize Brainfuck code compilation for c
- Interpret Brainfuck
- Provide a CLI for Brainfuck
- New Brainfuck operations, which I call Brainfuck+. `*` to reset the pointer to 0 and `;` to clear the memory

## TODO

- Add compilation for other languages, like rust or maybe assembly

- Support importing other Brainfuck files inside Brainfuck files | @import
